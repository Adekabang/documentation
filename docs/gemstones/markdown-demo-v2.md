## The Demo

> This is a quote example. Nicely formatted.

Sometimes you will see things like _this_..

How about a little **bold face**

Most of the time, it straight text like this.

Sometimes you need to show a `command`

Or multiple commands:

```
dnf install my_stapler
dnf update my_pencil
```

At other times, you need bulleted or numbered lists:

- I believe you have my stapler
- If not, please at least return my pencil

1. Here is your broken pencil
2. Sharpening it is useless

And you could need an admonition:

!!! TIP

    Pencils and staplers are really old-school.
