Once upon a time long ago, there was an ancient kingdom, the kingdom of Crowdin. Where everything ran smoothly, all languages had its unique markers, and all translations were always correct and indexed regularly.

But one day an unknown knight named Rocky loomed on the horizon, bringing havoc to the kingdom. The new knight had no well-defined markers and was fed by wicked authors who used an indecipherable language called markdown.

The disarray was such that for months the rulers of Crowdin tried unsuccessfully to give a logical order to the new language brought by Rocky, but without success.

Until one day through the magic of a very powerful wizard the arcane meaning of the markdown language was revealed.

And the kingdom returned to life happy and translated.
