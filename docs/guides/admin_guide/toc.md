# Introduction

This is a collection of educational documents focused on System Administrators. They can be used by future System Administrators trying to get up to speed, by current System Administrators who would like a refresher, or by any Linux user who'd like to learn more about the Linux environment, commands, processes, and more. Like all documents of this type, it is meant to evolve and update.

First, we will discuss Linux, distributions, and the whole ecosystem around our operating system.

We will then look at the user commands that are essential for getting to grips with Linux. The more experienced users will also be able to consult the chapter dedicated to the more "advanced" commands.

A chapter that seems to us to be as important as ever comes next: getting to grips with the VI editor, or at least its demystification: knowing how to open a file, save, quit or quit without saving. As for the other functions, the user will become more comfortable with them as he uses this editor, which is unlike any other but so powerful.

We can then get into the heart of the matter and into the functioning of Linux to discover how the system manages :

* users,
* file systems,
* processes.

We will make an aside on backups, a subject that is always so important that it is essential to talk about it: we will never make enough backups. We will discover two tools: `tar` but also `cpio`, less widespread, which in certain cases can be very interesting.

We will come back to the management of the system with the boot, which has evolved enormously in recent years since the arrival of systemd.

We will conclude by studying the management of tasks, the implementation of the network and the installation of software.

Enjoy your reading.
