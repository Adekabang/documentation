# Release Notes For Rocky Linux 9.0

## Major Changes

For a complete list of major changes, please see the upstream listing [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.0_release_notes/overview#overview-major-changes).

Below are some highlights.

### Security

* Using **SHA-1** message digest for cryptographic purposes has been deprecated. The digest is not considered secure.  There are some exceptions, which are detailed in the upstream link above.
* **OpenSSL** is now version 3.0.1 with many improvements, including provider concept, new versioning scheme, an improved HTTP(S) client, support for new protocols, formats, and algorithms, and more.
* **OpenSSH** is now version 8.7p1 with many improvements, most notably the replacement of the SCP/RCP protocol with the SFTP protocol which offers more predictable filename handling.
* **SELinux** performance, memory overhead, time to load, and more have been substantially improved. There are a whole host of changes with more details in the upstream link above.

### Networking

Some highlights are below. You can take a look at the details of networking changes by visiting the upstream link [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.0_release_notes/new-features#enhancement_networking).

* **mptcpd** or MultiPath TCP Daemon, can be used instead of `iproute2` to configure MultiPath TCP endpoints.
* NetworkManager now uses key files to store new connection profiles as a default, but still supports the use of `ifcfg`.
* **iptables-nft** and **ipset** are now deprecated which included the utilities, `iptables`, `ip6tables`, `ebtables`, and `arptables`. These are all replaced by the `nftables` framework.
