# Release Notes For Rocky Linux 9.2

## Major Changes

For a complete list of major changes, please see the upstream listing [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9-beta/html-single/9.2_release_notes/index).

### Installer and image creation

* Image builder now offers a new and improved way to create blueprints and images in the image builder web console.
* Creating customized files and directories in the /etc directory is now supported.


Some highlights and new features from this release are detailed next.


### Security

Security-related highlights in the latest Rocky Linux 9.2 release are:

* The Libreswan IPsec implementation was rebased to version 4.9." to the Security Overview in 9.2
* The OpenSSL secure communications library was rebased to version 3.0.7.
* SELinux user-space packages were updated to version 3.5.
* OpenSCAP was rebased to version 1.3.7.
* SCAP Security Guide was rebased to version 0.1.66.
* A new rule for idle session termination was added to SCAP.
* Clevis now accepts external tokens.
* Rsyslog TLS-encrypted logging now supports multiple CA files.
* Rsyslog privileges are limited to minimize security exposure.



### Networking

The main networking related changes are listed below. For detailed coverage of these changes as well as other network related changes please visit the upstream link [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9-2/html-single/9.2_release_notes/index#new-features-networking).

* NetworkManager rebased to version 1.42.2The NetworkManager packages have been upgraded to upstream version 1.42.2, which provides a number of enhancements and bug fixes over the previous version
* Introduction of the weight property in ECMP routing with NetworkManager
With this update, Rocky Linux 9 supports a new property weight when defining IPv4 Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routes. You can configure multipath routing using NetworkManager to load-balance and stabilize network traffic. This allows for multiple paths to be used for data transmission between two nodes, which improves the network efficiency and provides redundancy in the event of a link failure. 
* NetworkManager update brings improved flexibility for DNS configuration across multiple networksWith this update, you can use the existing [global-dns] section in the /etc/Networkmanager/NetworkManager.conf file to configure DNS options without specifying the nameserver value in the [global-dns-domain-*] section. This enables you to configure DNS options in the /etc/resolv.conf file while still relying on the DNS servers provided by the network connection for actual DNS resolution. As a result, the feature makes it easier and more flexible to manage your DNS settings when connecting to different networks with different DNS servers. Especially when you use the /etc/resolv.conf file to configure DNS options.* NetworkManager now supports a new vlan.protocol property
With this update, the vlan interface type now accepts a new protocol property. The property type is string. The accepted values are either 802.1Q (default), or 802.1ad. The new property specifies which VLAN protocol controls the tag identifier for encapsulation.* NetworkManager now allows VLAN configuration over unmanaged interfaceWith this enhancement, you can use an unmanaged networking interface as a base interface when configuring virtual LAN (VLAN) with NetworkManager. As a result, the VLAN base interface remains intact unless changed explicitly through the nmcli device set enp1s0 managed true command or other API of NetworkManager.
* Configuring Multipath TCP using NetworkManager is now fully supportedWith this update, the NetworkManager utility provides you with the Multipath TCP (MPTCP) functionality. You can use nmcli commands to control MPTCP and make its settings persistent.
* The NetworkManager utility now supports activating connections on the loopback interface* The balance-slb bonding mode is now supportedThe new balance-slb bonding mode Source load balancing requires no switch configuration. The balance-slb divides traffic on the source ethernet address using xmit_hash_policy=vlan+srcmac, and NetworkManager adds necessary nftables rules for traffic filtering. As a result, you can now create bond profiles with the balance-slb option enabled by using NetworkManager.
* firewalld rebased to version 1.2The firewalld package has been upgraded to version 1.2, which provides multiple enhancements. * The firewalld now supports the startup failsafe mechanismWith this enhancement, firewalld will fall back to failsafe defaults in case of a startup failure. This feature protects the host in case of invalid configurations or other startup issues. As a result, even if the user configuration is invalid, hosts running firewalld are now startup failsafe.* conntrack-tools rebased to version 1.4.7The conntrack-tools package has been upgraded to version 1.4.7, which provides multiple bug fixes and enhancements.

* The nmstate API now supports IPv6 link-local addresses as DNS serversWith this enhancement, you can use the nmstate API to set IPv6 link-local addresses as DNS servers. 
* The nmstate API now supports MPTCP flagsThis update enhances the nmstate API with support for MultiPath TCP (MPTCP) flags. As a result, you can use nmstate to set MPTCP address flags on interfaces with static or dynamic IP addresses.
* The min-mtu and max-mtu properties added to MTU on all interfacesPreviously, an exception message was not clear enough to understand the supported MTU ranges. This update introduces the min-mtu and max-mtu properties to all interfaces. As a result, nmstate will indicate the supported MTU range when the desired MTU is out of range.
* NetworkManager now allows VLAN configuration over unmanaged interfaceYou can use an unmanaged networking interface as a base interface when configuring virtual LAN (VLAN) with NetworkManager. As a result, the VLAN base interface remains intact unless changed explicitly through the nmcli device set enp1s0 managed true command or other API of NetworkManager.
* The balance-slb bonding mode is now supportedThe new balance-slb bonding mode Source load balancing requires no switch configuration. The balance-slb divides traffic on the source Ethernet address using xmit_hash_policy=vlan+srcmac, and NetworkManager adds necessary nftables rules for traffic filtering. As a result, you can now create bond profiles with the balance-slb option enabled by using NetworkManager.
* A new weight property in NmstateThis update introduces the weight property in the Nmstate API and tooling suite. You can use weight to specify the relative weight of each path in the Equal Cost Multi-Path routes (ECMP) group. The weight is a number between 1 and 256. As a result, weight property in Nmstate provides greater flexibility and control over traffic distribution in an ECMP group.
* xdp-tools rebased to version 1.3.1The xdp-tools packages have been upgraded to upstream version 1.3.1, which provides a number of enhancements and bug fixes over the previous version
* iproute rebased to version 6.1.0The iproute package has been upgraded to version 6.1.0, which provides multiple bug fixes and enhancements. 
* The kernel now logs the listening address in SYN flood messagesThis enhancement adds the listening IP address to SYN flood messages. As a result, if many processes are bound to the same port on different IP addresses, administrators can now clearly identify the affected socket.
