### New Build system (Peridot)

Rocky Linux 9 was lovingly built with our in-house developed and open-source Cloud Native build system called Peridot. Peridot was used to build Rocky Linux 9 for the -  x86_64, aarch64, s390x, and ppc64le architectures.

Amongst other things, this release represents our standing promise and commitment to the community to ensure the longevity of the Rocky Linux project by enabling users to build, enhance or reproduce Rocky Linux from scratch independently.
