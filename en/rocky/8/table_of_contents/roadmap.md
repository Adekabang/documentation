## Step details

### Decide on the workflow

* Define the pull requests reviewing process:
	* What exactly should be reviewed and by whom ?
	* Do we need approvers in addition of reviewers ?
* Make a workflow diagram
* Organize the [documentation repository](https://github.com/rocky-linux/documentation) accordingly (create branches).

### Update the guidelines

Revisit the writing and contributing guidelines according to what has been decided earlier.

### Training materials

Write some training materials for docs writers and editors.

### Communicate

Publish a « state of the docs » blog post to let the community informed about what has been done and what are the future plans.
